# **CASSAVA LEAF DISEASE DETECTION**

-   Classification of leaf disease of the cassava plant.
    
-   Cassava is major food crop grown in Africa.
    
-   CNN’s are usually used in case of image classification due to their ability to extract higher order features in the images.
    
-   Custom CNN implementations.
    
-   2 pretrained models VGG-16 and Resnet50 .


# **Understanding the Problem**

-   Cassava is the third largest source of carbohydrates for human food in the world but is vulnerable to virus diseases, which threaten to destabilize food security in sub-Saharan Africa.
    
-   The diseases affect the overall production of cassava plant crop which leads to food shortage in Africa .
    
-   Existing methods need a manual inspection of plants which is very slow and costly and will adversely affect production and farmer’s livelihood

## **Project objective**

-   Create a machine learning model which can detect the disease pattern at very early stage.
    
-   With the help of Machine Learning Models, it is possible to identify common diseases so they can be treated.
    
-   Image classification algorithms in machine learning can predict whether a particular cassava plant leaf has a disease pattern or not.
    
-   It will be a fast and inexpensive way to identify leaf diseases and can reach to the larger population in less time.

## **Dataset**

-   The original dataset contained around 21k images of cassava leaves of size 800x600.
    
-   We only used only 1000 colored images for training and 100 images for testing .

### These images are classified into five classes :
    

-   Cassava Bacterial Blight (CBB)
    
-   Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD)
    
-   Cassava Green Mottle (CGM)
    
-   Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD)
    
-   Healthy.
